## Getting Started

First, install packages via NPM:
```bash
npm install
```

(We currently use node version v12.13.1, so all packages _should_ run within that verison)

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Good to know
You will find `styled-components` already installed, this is the preferred method for doing CSS styling at Foxtrot. But, if you feel more comfortable using another method, feel free!

## What you'll be doing

- Investigate attatched comp to see what your final results should look like
- Scaffold app to your liking
- Run GET on `https://api.foxtrotchicago.com/v5/inventory/aisles/224/items?store_id=6` to retrieve products and groups
- Whatever else you think is cool! Don't spend an inordinate amount of time on this, but please do highlight your skills!

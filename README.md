## Getting Started

First, install packages via NPM:
```bash
npm install
```

(We currently use node version v12.13.1, so all packages _should_ run within that verison)

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
